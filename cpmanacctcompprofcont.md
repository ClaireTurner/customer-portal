# Updating important contact information
{: #customerportal_upcompprofandcont}

Each SoftLayer account has an associated company profile that contains the company information and details regarding the primary account holder. You can use data from the company profile when you set up contacts and user profiles. Each SoftLayer account also contains a variety of account-specific contacts that are used in association with services available on the account, such as image publishing (CDN) or SOC. If you are the master user of an account or have administrative access to it, you can update your contact information.

## Updating your company profile
{: #cp_updcompprof}

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure uses the information in the company profile to contact you. If your phone number or primary contact email changes, be sure to update them. The company profile information is entered into {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure at the time the account was created and can be found in a variety of places on the customer portal.

You can change the company profile at any time by submitting a change request. Associated details are verified and the changes are updated after they are validated. Use the following steps to request an update to the company profile.

1. Access the customer portal using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Account** > **Manage** > **Company Profile** from the menu to access the Account Profile window.
3. Update the details in the **Company Information** or **Primary Account Holder** section, or both.
> **Note:** Information in the account profile is used for internal, administrative purposes only.
4. Click **Submit Update Request**.

After requesting an update to the company profile, a {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure team member reviews the request. If any additional information requires verification, the information is verified. After all changes have been approved, the account profile is updated as requested.

## Adding or editing an account contact

Use the following steps to add or edit an account contact.

1. Access the customer portal using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Account** > **Manage** > **Company Contacts** from the menu.
3. Enter or update the contact information for the **Contact Type**.<br/>**Note:** Ensure that you provide the contact information for the person who should receive inquiries regarding the specific type of contact that will be made by the contact type. Verify the information before you make the update.
4. Click **Save**.

After you submit the new contact information, the account contacts are updated immediately.
