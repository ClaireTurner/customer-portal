# Updating important contact information
{: #customerportal_upcompprofandcont}

Each SoftLayer account has an associated company profile that contains the company information and details about the primary account holder. You can use data from the company profile when you set up contacts and user profiles. Each SoftLayer account also contains various account-specific contacts that are used in association with services available on the account, such as image publishing (CDN) or SOC. If you're the master user of an account or have administrative access to it, you can update your contact information.

## Updating your company profile
{: #cp_updateprofile}

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure uses the information in the company profile to contact you. If your phone number or primary contact email changes, be sure to update them. The company profile information is entered into {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure at the time the account was created and can be found in various places on the customer portal.

You can change the company profile at any time by submitting a change request. Associated details are verified and the changes are updated after they're validated. Use the following steps to request an update to the company profile.

1. Access the customer portal by using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Account** > **Manage** > **Company Profile** from the menu to access the Account Profile window.
3. Update the details in the **Company Information** or **Primary Account Holder** section, or both.
> **Note:** Information in the account profile is used for internal, administrative purposes only.
4. Optionally, select **EU Supported** if you want to ensure that the support team in Europe handles your maintenance and support issues. For more information about this option, see [Setting the European supported option](/docs/customer-portal?topic=customer-portal-cp_seteusupported#cp_seteusupported).
5. Click **Submit Update Request**.

After you request an update to the company profile, a {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure team member reviews the request. If any additional information requires verification, the information is verified. After all changes are approved, the account profile is updated as requested.

## Adding or editing an account contact
{: #cp_addoreditacct}

Keep the information about the contacts for your account complete and up-to-date in case an inquiry is required. Ensure that the account contacts are the appropriate people to be contacted for each type of request. You might have more than one contact entry for each account, but only one contact for each type of service. Account-specific contact information doesn't include the account profile, which is the primary contact information that is associated with an account. Use the following steps to add or edit an account contact.

1. Access the customer portal by using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Account** > **Manage** > **Company Contacts** from the menu.
3. Enter or update the contact information for the **Contact Type**.<br/>**Note:** Ensure that you provide the contact information for the person who should receive inquiries about the specific type of contact by the contact type. Verify the information before you make the update.
4. Click **Save**.

After you submit the new contact information, the account contacts are updated immediately.
