# Accessing infrastructure resources
{: #accessinfrastructure}

You can use infrastructure resources when you build your apps in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} public environment. 
{: shortdesc}

Use infrastructure resources to build virtual environments, provide storage, establish a network, and secure your environment. For more information, see [Platform overview](/docs/overview/ibm-cloud.html). 

To access infrastructure resources you must have a Pay-As-You-Go account. The following table lists the different accounts and your options for accessing infrastructure resources. 

|{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Account Type |	Infrastructure Access? |	What Are My Options? |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
|Free account (Lite or 30-day trial) |	No access |	Upgrade your free account to a Pay-As-You-Go account |
|Pay-As-You-Go account | Yes, if your account was created after 24 October 2016 | Nothing else is required | 
| | No access if your account was created before 24 October 2016 | Add your credit card details again |
|Subscription account |	No access |	Create a separate Pay-As-You-Go account with a different email address than the email address that's associated with your Subscription account |

When you request to upgrade your account, the information that you enter is checked and must be approved before you can access infrastructure resources. Ensure that the contact information is correct because the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support team might contact you to confirm certain details.
