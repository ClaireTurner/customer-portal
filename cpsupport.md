# Getting support for {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure
{: #customerportal_support}

If you experience problems with {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure and you do not have a linked account, you can get help with determining the cause of the problem and finding a solution using the customer portal.
{:shortdesc}

If you have a [linked account](/docs/account/softlayerlink.html#link_user_accounts), you can get support through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. See [Getting customer support](/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html) for more information.

If you do not have a linked account, you can open support tickets in {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure customer portal for general technical issues or to assist with issues related to your account.

## Creating a general technical support ticket
{: #cp_creatsuptickwsp}

You can open {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure tickets for general technical issues in the customer portal using the following steps:

1. Log in to the [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Support** > **Add Ticket** from the menu.
3. Select the category that best fits the reason from opening a ticket from the **Subject** list.
4. Select your user name from the **Assign To** list.<br/>

  If you are opening a ticket for another user, select that user from the list.
  {:tip}

5. Enter a brief description of the question or issue in the **Title** field.
6. If email updates should be sent when the ticket is updated, indicate to whom:
  * If updates should be sent to the assignee, select the **Email me updates?** check box. If you are not the assignee, selecting the **Email me updates?** check box results in the assignee being sent updates, as it is linked with the **Assign to** list.
  * If email updates should be sent to others, in the **Email Others** field, enter the email address of the user to receive updates, or select the email address from the list. Then, click **Add Recipient**. Repeat these steps until all recipients have been added. You can add up to five recipients per ticket, in addition to the assignee.
7. If devices are associated with an existing ticket, enter the device name in the **Associated Devices** field or select the device from the list, then click **Add Device**. Repeat these steps until all devices have been added.

  You can associate up to five devices with a ticket. Rather than creating multiple tickets for each device that is experiencing the same issue or outage, associate up to five devices in your ticket and they can all be handled at once. This also ensures that the support team is aware of a widespread issue on your account and can resolve the issue in all locations.
  {:tip}

8. Enter any information regarding the ticket in the **Details** field.

  When reporting an issue, include as much information as possible, including what actions took place during or when the issue occurred and screen shots, if available.
  {:tip}

9. If files are to be attached to the ticket, click **Attach Files** and select the files to be attached to the ticket.

  You can attach up to two files to a ticket.
  {:tip}

10. Select a data center from the **EU Supported** list if you are a customer in Europe and you require that the support team handling your tickets must also be in Europe.

  Select **None** if you do not require that your support team is physically located in Europe.
  {: tip}

  See [Setting the EU support option](/docs/customer-portal/cpmanuserprof.html#cp_seteusupported) for information about initializing this function for your account.

11. Click **Add Ticket**.

After you add a ticket, it is routed to the appropriate member of the Support team for resolution. Tickets are handled based on the degree of severity, meaning that the most severe issues, such as outages, are handled first, followed by service degrading issues, and then questions. A member of the Support team will be in contact with the assignees regarding additional information to resolve the ticket.

## Creating a ticket for account issues
{: #cp_creatacctsuptickwsp}

You can open {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure tickets to assist with issues related to your account in the customer portal similarly to the way you open a ticket for general technical support issues, but with one important difference.  

After you log in to the [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} and select **Support** > **Add Ticket**, you must ensure that the ticket is routed to the correct support team and can be resolved quickly. To route the ticket correctly to handle account issues, from the **Subject** list, select the **Accounting Request**.

Complete the rest of the ticket as you would to create a ticket for general technical support and submit the ticket. With the **Subject** set to **Accounting Request**, the correct support team is assigned the ticket and can help resolve the issue quickly.

## Viewing an existing ticket
{: #cp_viewsuptickwsp}

After you add a ticket, you can view it at any time from the **Tickets** window. You can see all details regarding the ticket and its history. Use the following steps to view an existing ticket.

1. Access the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Support** > **Tickets** from the menu.
3. Select the status of the ticket from the drop down menu to filter the view.
4. Click the ticket number to view the details of the ticket.

## Updating a ticket
{: #cp_updatsuptickwsp}

You can update an existing support ticket at any time to include additional comments or attachments and you can also assign it to another user on the account. You might need to add comments or attachments to assist the support team with issue resolution. Use the following steps to update an existing ticket.

1. Access the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Support** > **Tickets** from the menu.
3. Select the status of the ticket from the drop down menu to filter the view.
4. Click the ticket number to view the details of the ticket.
5. Update the ticket, as necessary. You can perform the following tasks:
  * Reassign a Ticket: from the **Reassign** drop down list, select the user to reassign the ticket to.   
  * Add a Comment: enter any comments in the **Comment** text box.
  * Attach a File: click **Attach Files** and select the files to be attached to the ticket. You can attach up to two (2) files to a ticket.
6. Click **Update**.

  At any time during the update process, you can open a chat session with a Support team member for assistance. Click **Start Chat** to open the chat session.
  {:tip}

If you reassign the ticket, the new assignee becomes the primary point of contact for issue resolution. If you add a comment or attachment, the Support team member working on the ticket reviews the new information to assist in issue resolution.
