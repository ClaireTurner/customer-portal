# Getting support for {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure
{: #customerportal_support}

If your SoftLayer account was created with the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal, and it is a linked account, you have multiple options for getting support. Whether or not you have a linked account, you can open {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure customer support tickets in the customer portal.
{:shortdesc}

If you have a [linked account](/docs/account/softlayerlink.html#link_user_accounts), you can open a support ticket in {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure, or see [Getting customer support](/docs/support/index.html#getting-customer-support){:new_window} for more information about getting support through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console.

## Creating a support ticket with customer portal
{: #cp_creatsuptickwsp}

You can open {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure customer support tickets in the customer portal to assist with issues related to your account or {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure in general.

1. Log in to the [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Support** > **Add Ticket** from the menu.
3. Select the category that best fits the reason from opening a ticket from the **Subject** list.
4. Select your user name from the **Assign To** list.<br/>

  If you are opening a ticket for another user, select that user from the list.
  {:tip}

5. Enter a brief description of the question or issue in the **Title** field.
6. If email updates should be sent when the ticket is updated, indicate to whom:
  * If updates should be sent to the assignee, select the **Email me updates?** check box. If you are not the assignee, selecting the **Email me updates?** check box results in the assignee being sent updates, as it is linked with the **Assign to** list.
  * If email updates should be sent to others, in the **Email Others** field, enter the email address of the user to receive updates, or select the email address from the list. Then, click **Add Recipient**. Repeat these steps until all recipients have been added. You can add up to five recipients per ticket, in addition to the assignee.
7. If devices are associated with an existing ticket, enter the device name in the **Associated Devices** field or select the device from the list, then click **Add Device**. Repeat these steps until all devices have been added.

  You can associate up to five devices with a ticket. Rather than creating multiple tickets for each device that is experiencing the same issue or outage, associate up to five devices in your ticket and they can all be handled at once. This also ensures that the support team is aware of a widespread issue on your account and can resolve the issue in all locations.
  {:tip}

8. Enter any information regarding the ticket in the **Details** field.

  When reporting an issue, include as much information as possible, including what actions took place during or when the issue occurred and screen shots, if available.
  {:tip}

9. If files are to be attached to the ticket, click **Attach Files** and select the files to be attached to the ticket.

  You can attach up to two files to a ticket.
  {:tip}

10. Select a data center from the **EU Supported** list if you are a customer in Europe and you require that the support team handling your tickets must also be in Europe.

  Select **None** if you do not require that your support team is physically located in Europe.
  {: tip}

  See [Setting the EU support option](/docs/customer-portal/cpmanuserprof.html#cp_seteusupported) for information about initializing this function for your account.

11. Click **Add Ticket**.

After you add a ticket, it is routed to the appropriate member of the Support team for resolution. Tickets are handled based on the degree of severity, meaning that the most severe issues, such as outages, are handled first, followed by service degrading issues, and then questions. A member of the Support team will be in contact with the assignees regarding additional information to resolve the ticket.

## Viewing an existing ticket
{: #cp_viewsuptickwsp}

After you add a ticket, you can view it at any time from the **Tickets** window. You can see all details regarding the ticket and its history. Use the following steps to view an existing ticket.

1. Access the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Support** > **Tickets** from the menu.
3. Select the status of the ticket from the drop down menu to filter the view.

## Updating a ticket
{: #cp_updatsuptickwsp}

You can update an existing support ticket at any time to include additional comments or attachments and you can also assign it to another user on the account. You might need to add comments or attachments to assist the support team with issue resolution. Use the following steps to update an existing ticket.

1. Access the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.

  * Reassign a Ticket: from the **Reassign** drop down list, select the user to reassign the ticket to.   
  * Add a Comment: enter any comments in the **Comment** text box.
  * Attach a File: click **Attach Files** and select the files to be attached to the ticket. You can attach up to two (2) files to a ticket.
6. Click **Update**.

  At any time during the update process, you can open a chat session with a Support team member for assistance. Click **Start Chat** to open the chat session.
  {:tip}

If you reassign the ticket, the new assignee becomes the primary point of contact for issue resolution. If you add a comment or attachment, the Support team member working on the ticket reviews the new information to assist in issue resolution.

## Escalating a support issue
{: #cp_bpsupescalflow}

If you have an issue that you need help resolving, you can open a support ticket.  If the issue is critical or urgent and you need to escalate the issue, use the following steps.

1. Open a support ticket from the customer portal, chat, or by phone (866-403-7638).

  When you create or update a ticket, include any errors, logs, or troubleshooting that has occurred as this helps to resolve the issue more quickly.
  {: tip}

2. Work with the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure Support Team in the ticket.  For example, if the support team asks for additional information, respond as quickly as you can.
3. If progress on the ticket stalls, you can escalate from the ticket by providing a comment like, *"please escalate this ticket due to customer impact,"* or by chat or by phone.
4. If the ticket does not progress after the initial request, you can escalate it to the Support Supervisor by requesting this escalation in the ticket.
5. If you are still not getting the progress you need after requesting help from the Support Supervisor, you can email the Support Management team at Notify-Support-WW@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com.

This distribution list notifies all of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure Support Management team to make sure all of the right resources are engaged to resolve your issue.
