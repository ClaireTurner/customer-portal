# Managing your billing items
{: #manage-billing}

If you are managing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} infrastructure billing for a SoftLayer account, you can manage your billing and payments in the customer portal. To manage {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform billing and payments, see [Managing billing and usage](/docs/pricing/index.html#accounts).
{:shortdesc}

## Accessing your billing items
{: #cp_accbillitems}

You can use the Manage Billing Items window in the [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} to associate billing items to specific devices and cancel those items, when necessary.

The Manage Billing Items window shows associated billing items. You can change the view by selecting another option from the **Display** drop down list. When you are viewing billing items, you can change unassociated billing items to be associated, and associated items to be dissociated. You can change associated and dissociated items individually, or for more than one item at a time, using the Bulk Actions feature. You can cancel individual billing items at any time from the Manage Billing Items window.


## Canceling a billing item
{: #cp_cancelbillitems}

You can cancel billing items directly from the Manage Billing Items window at any time. You can initiate cancellations for most services and solutions immediately, with cancellation taking place either immediately or on the billing anniversary.

> **Note:** Data stored on any device, service or solution that is canceled cannot be retrieved after cancellation. Back up all data that should be saved before completing the cancellation request.

Use the following steps to cancel a billing item.

1. Back up all data you want to save for the service or solution you want to cancel.
2. Access the [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
3. Select **Account** > **Billing** > **Billing Items** to access the Manage Billing Items window.
4. Select **Cancel Billing Items** from the **Actions** drop down list for the billing item to cancel.
5. Select the cancellation option to specify the cancellation date.
>**Note**: Immediate cancellations are processed when the request is submitted, with no refunds issued. Anniversary date cancellations are initiated immediately; however, the billing item remains active until the next anniversary date, which is provided when making the selection.
6. Enter the **reason for cancellation** in the **Notes** text box.
7. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next window in the cancellation process.
8. Review the **Terms of Service** provided in the cancellation warning and click the **Acknowledgement** check box.
9. Click **Cancel Service**.

After you confirm the cancellation, the billing item cancellation process begins. If you requested an immediate cancellation, the billing item is canceled immediately. If you requested a billing anniversary cancellation, the billing item remains active until the next billing anniversary. Upon its cancellation, the billing item is no longer active within the customer portal. Billing items are also removed from invoices when all outstanding balances have been paid on the service or solution, if any. Refunds cannot be given for immediate cancellations.
