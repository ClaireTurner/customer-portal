# Transitioning to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} experience
{: #redirect-cloud}

As part of migrating from SoftLayer to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, get familiar with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, which you use to manage both your platform and infrastructure resources. We're currently in the process of linking all SoftLayer and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts. Therefore, your account might not have access yet. As soon as it does, you can check out the new experience. See the following image for the detailed mapping of where you can find your resources.

The formerly named SoftLayer is now called {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure.
