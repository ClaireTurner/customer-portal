# What is the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal?
{: #customerportal_whatisCP}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console to manage much of your infrastructure.  However, the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure customer portal does provide some additional function to manage infrastructure products and services and SoftLayer accounts.
{:shortdesc}

You would use the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal, instead of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, for the following reasons:
  * If you are using only {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure services (and not the platform services) and you do not have a [linked account](/docs/cloud-platform/accounts/softlayerlink.html#link_user_accounts).
  * If you do not have an [IBMid](/docs/admin/softlayerlink.html#switching-to-ibmid).
  * If you need access to a federal environment, for example, a United States government agency might require a securely locked down data center with limited external access. Only {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure services are available in this environment; {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform access is not available in a federal environment.

You would then use the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure customer portal for the following tasks:
  * Ordering and interacting with infrastructure products and services, for example adding and managing devices and [virtual servers](/docs/vsi/vsi_index.html#getting-started-with-virtual-servers)
  * Managing and maintaining your linked or unlinked SoftLayer accounts
  * Viewing and paying monthly infrastructure resource invoices
  * Opening, viewing, and updating tickets associated with any {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure product or service

For everything else, use the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://console.bluemix.net){: new_window}

You can access the customer portal in the following ways:
* From the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://console.bluemix.net){: new_window} menu by selecting **Infrastructure** from the menu bar Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg).  For more information, see [How the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console works](/docs/overview/ui.html#ui).
* From the SoftLayer [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} directly.
