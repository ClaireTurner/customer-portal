# What is the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal?
{: #customerportal_whatisCP}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console to manage much of your infrastructure. However, the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure customer portal does provide some additional function to manage infrastructure products and services and SoftLayer accounts.
{:shortdesc}

You would use the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal, instead of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, for the following reasons:
  * If you're using only {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure services (and not the platform services) and you don't have a [linked account](/docs/account?topic=account-link_customer_accounts#link_customer_accounts).
  * If you don't have an [IBMid](/docs/account?topic=account-switchtoIBMid#switchtoIBMid).
  * If you need access to a federal environment, for example, a United States government agency might require a more securely locked down data center with limited external access. Only {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure services are available in this environment; {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform access isn't available in a federal data center.

You would then use the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure customer portal for the following tasks:
  * Managing access of your resources, monitoring resources, and viewing access logs
  * Ordering and interacting with infrastructure products and services, for example, adding and managing devices and [virtual servers](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-getting-started-tutorial#getting-started-tutorial).
  * Managing and maintaining your linked or unlinked SoftLayer accounts
  * Viewing and paying monthly infrastructure resource invoices
  * Opening, viewing, and updating tickets associated with any {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure product or service

For everything else, use the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://cloud.ibm.com){: new_window}

You can access the customer portal in the following ways:
* From the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://cloud.ibm.com){: new_window} menu by selecting **Infrastructure** from the menu bar ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg). For more information, see [Navigating the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#ui).
* From the SoftLayer [customer portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} directly.
